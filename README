 -[ ] Better testing
 -[ ] Better pretty printing (read: code formatter)
 -[ ] Refactor error handling (ie. SyntaxError, NameError, etc.)
 -[ ] Run code in REPL
 -[ ] Support top-level expressions in REPL
 -[ ] More builtin types (ie. i8, i16, i32, unsigned ints, bools, floats)
 -[ ] User-defined types (ie. structs, unions?)
